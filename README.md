# deepmind-staff-analysis
Quick and dirty analysis of the Deepmind staff with data from Linkedin. 

- Code is pretty simple and shown in the IPython notebook. Let me know if you're interested in any specific detailed analysis. 
- The data might not be complete as I believe Linkedin restricts to 1000 search results (although that is roughly the size of Deepmind?)

Example: A Bar plot of scientists and engineers :)
